    Have something to share? Sweet. Metasploit wouldn't be where it is
    today without the hundreds of contributors who have pitched in over
    the years.

    This is the purposefully short blurb that everyone who wants to file
    an issue against the Metasploit Framework repo should have already
    read. It even has a handy shortlink in the 'r-7.co' domain -- this
    makes it easy for regular contributors can gently remind
    would-be contributors to glance over it when submitting bugs and
    features.
